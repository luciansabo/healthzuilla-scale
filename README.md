# Healthzuilla Scale

This is a WiFi-enabled weight scale, meant to primarily weight food and track calories. This is useful if you are on a diet, if you track your calorie intake for maintaining your weight or if you are into fitness and simply want to improve your results by keeping an eye on nutrition.

It can weigh food with a very good precision up to a 10th of a gram, calculate energy in calories, display this info on the LCD, and using the RESTful API you can transfer the weight information, adjust settings or control the scale remotely.
